  My first trip with Mantra Yatra was to Badri, Kedar.  Balaji's meticulous
  planning made this once a life time trip for me so pleasant and memorable! 
  Eleven days with a new family went like a breeze!!  The very fact that I am
  making my third trip in such a short duration with Mantra speaks volumes!!!
